# Learning C

This repo is a *WIP* guide for those who wish to learn C. Each **chapter** includes its own `README` and corresponding C programs, which must be compiled before they are run. Most of the chapters in this guide are my notes while working through [Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie's book _The C Programming Language_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language). 

On most machines you can use the `cc` or `gcc` commands like so: `cd example-directory/examples && gcc example.c` then run `./a.out`
