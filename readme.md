# Learning C

This repo is a *WIP* guide for those who wish to learn C. Each **chapter** includes its own `README` and corresponding C programs, which must be compiled before they are run. 

If you are on a mac you can use `gcc`: `cd example-directory && gcc example.c` then run `./a.out`

## Chapters
1. [printf and scanf](https://github.com/jaqarrick/c-info/tree/main/1-print-scanf/printf-scanf.md)
2. Variables and Constants in C (WIP)

***More to come!***
